TI  - Consensus strategy in genes prioritization and combined bioinformatics analysis
      for preeclampsia pathogenesis.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1186/s12920-017-0286-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a multifactorial disease with unknown pathogenesis.
      Even when recent studies explored this disease using several bioinformatics
      tools, the main objective was not directed to pathogenesis. Additionally,
      consensus prioritization was proved to be highly efficient in the recognition of 
      genes-disease association. However, not information is available about the
      consensus ability to early recognize genes directly involved in pathogenesis.
      Therefore our aim in this study is to apply several theoretical approaches to
      explore preeclampsia; specifically those genes directly involved in the
      pathogenesis. METHODS: We firstly evaluated the consensus between 12
      prioritization strategies to early recognize pathogenic genes related to
      preeclampsia. A communality analysis in the protein-protein interaction network
      of previously selected genes was done including further enrichment analysis. The 
      enrichment analysis includes metabolic pathways as well as gene ontology.
      Microarray data was also collected and used in order to confirm our results or as
      a strategy to weight the previously enriched pathways. RESULTS: The consensus
      prioritized gene list was rationally filtered to 476 genes using several
      criteria. The communality analysis showed an enrichment of communities connected 
      with VEGF-signaling pathway. This pathway is also enriched considering the
      microarray data. Our result point to VEGF, FLT1 and KDR as relevant pathogenic
      genes, as well as those connected with NO metabolism. CONCLUSION: Our results
      revealed that consensus strategy improve the detection and initial enrichment of 
      pathogenic genes, at least in preeclampsia condition. Moreover the combination of
      the first percent of the prioritized genes with protein-protein interaction
      network followed by communality analysis reduces the gene space. This approach
      actually identifies well known genes related with pathogenesis. However, genes
      like HSP90, PAK2, CD247 and others included in the first 1% of the prioritized
      list need to be further explored in preeclampsia pathogenesis through
      experimental approaches.

TI  - Fine-grained parallelization of fitness functions in bioinformatics optimization 
      problems: gene selection for cancer classification and biclustering of gene
      expression data.
PG  - 330
LID - 10.1186/s12859-016-1200-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metaheuristics are widely used to solve large combinatorial
      optimization problems in bioinformatics because of the huge set of possible
      solutions. Two representative problems are gene selection for cancer
      classification and biclustering of gene expression data. In most cases, these
      metaheuristics, as well as other non-linear techniques, apply a fitness function 
      to each possible solution with a size-limited population, and that step involves 
      higher latencies than other parts of the algorithms, which is the reason why the 
      execution time of the applications will mainly depend on the execution time of
      the fitness function. In addition, it is usual to find floating-point arithmetic 
      formulations for the fitness functions. This way, a careful parallelization of
      these functions using the reconfigurable hardware technology will accelerate the 
      computation, specially if they are applied in parallel to several solutions of
      the population. RESULTS: A fine-grained parallelization of two floating-point
      fitness functions of different complexities and features involved in biclustering
      of gene expression data and gene selection for cancer classification allowed for 
      obtaining higher speedups and power-reduced computation with regard to usual
      microprocessors. CONCLUSIONS: The results show better performances using
      reconfigurable hardware technology instead of usual microprocessors, in computing
      time and power consumption terms, not only because of the parallelization of the 
      arithmetic operations, but also thanks to the concurrent fitness evaluation for
      several individuals of the population in the metaheuristic. This is a good basis 
      for building accelerated and low-energy solutions for intensive computing
      scenarios.
